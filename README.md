# R can help choose dinner 🥘😎 - An illustration  of randomly selecting rows of a dataframe

## 30.04.2023

Having relocated from Kenya to Manchester, England, I found myself in a new environment with unfamiliar cultural practices and cuisine. When asked to choose my preferences for a Christmas party at The University of Manchester, where I currently work, I struggled to decide what starter, main course, and dessert to select due to the descriptions being unfamiliar to me. It was at this point that I realised that R could assist me with this decision. As a result, I created a tibble named `dinner_df` in R with columns labelled `starter`, `main`, and `dessert`, which contained a list of options to choose from.

I had the pleasure of savoring a delicious meal that consisted of Devon brown crab crumpet with piccalilli, pink grapefruit, and mint, Braised ox cheek as the starter, served with Boulongerer potato, carrot, bone marrow, and red wine as the main course, and a delectable Chocolate Fondant with salted caramel ice cream and boozy cherry as the dessert! 🙌🏿 😊
